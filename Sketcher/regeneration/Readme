The Proj Generative is built on Python3.9 with tensorflow 2.7.0
The Generative is adopted to generate more operations associating with the Tree-RNN, where the Tree-RNN is a text-generation RNN model to generate more words based on training data.

Data Format:
    For each Tree, we have a sequence of actions, each of which touches one tree node per time.
    For every action, the format is (layer, offset), weight.

The training phase is to feed the generated actions into RNN, before which the tree-generation and action generationa are conducted by Dir TreeGenerator

Workflow:

  (1) Run InitTree.py with two functions to generate the tree (i.,e., specify the path, number total nodes, number of depth)
  (2) Training:
        (a) tune the paras in N_Pats/paras.py
        (b) Run N_Pats/N_Pats.py to persist the trained model
  (c) Inference: Run N_Pats/Predict.py to invoke the saved model and to predict
