This Proj Epitomazor is conducted to extract features from raw NFS traces

(1) The NFS traces are collected by Ftrace and are stored as log files e.g., logs/videoserver.log
(2) Optional* AggregateTraces.py is used to aggregate several log files as a whole to extract sketches
(3) ExtractPatterns.py is the main logic of extracting sketches from the log, after which the extracted sketches are stored as *.csv
(4) Optiaonal ShowPats.py is to plot the sketches

The path is required by each snippet.

** Due to confidential issues, the code for "dynamic weight scaling" is not available. You can try it based on the formulation and description that will be available soon.
